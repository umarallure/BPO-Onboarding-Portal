## Features

### Bulk Duplicate Lookup
The agent portal includes a powerful bulk lookup feature that helps identify duplicate entries with pending approval status.

**How it works:**
1. Upload a CSV file containing phone numbers, lead vendors, and insured names
2. The system searches for duplicate entries in the daily deal flow table
3. Returns all entries where there are multiple records with at least one having 'Pending Approval' status
4. Export results to CSV for further analysis

**CSV Format Requirements:**
- Must include columns for phone number, lead vendor, and insured name
- Column headers should contain: phone, lead vendor, insured name
- One entry per row to check for duplicates

**Access:** Available to authorized users via the "Bulk Lookup" button in the dashboard header.
